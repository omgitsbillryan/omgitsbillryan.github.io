<p>I am software / devops engineer with a Ruby on Rails &amp; AWS background. As a backend RoR
developer I spent so much of my time with the Operations &amp; infrastructure team, that I
ended up joining them.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last 5 years developing &amp; maintaining the VA.gov website. Before that,
I dabbled in some Android mobile development and was a Java engineer who worked for
RSA Security.</p>

<p>I’ve tinkered with computers my entire life - both building them and developing
software.</p>
