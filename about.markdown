![My Headshot](/assets/bill_headshot.png)

Welcome to my page.

I am software / devops engineer with a Ruby on Rails & AWS background. As a backend RoR
developer I spent so much of my time with the Operations & infrastructure team, that I
ended up joining them. 

I've spent the last 5 years developing & maintaining the VA.gov website. Before that,
I dabbled in some Android mobile development and was a Java engineer who worked for
RSA Security.

I've tinkered with computers my entire life - both building them and developing
software.
